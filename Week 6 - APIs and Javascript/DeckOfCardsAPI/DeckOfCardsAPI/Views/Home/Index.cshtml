@model DeckDrawsViewModel
@*     we need a deck id on top of the cards from the api, but those are stored in 2 different models, how do we proceed? 
    We will need to create a viewmodel - this a model that exist purely for a view, otfentimes used to make displaying easier 
    or to carry around multiple unrelated models all at once.

@foreach(Card c in Model.Cards)
{
    <img src="@c.image" />
}

<a asp-action="DrawMore" asp-controller="Home" asp-route-deckId="@Model.Deck.deck_id">Draw 5 more cards</a>
